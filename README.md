# Concert Finder

## Description

When a user puts in the name of an artist, it will return a list of up to three of their upcoming concerts, the dates, cities, venues, average price, and a link to buy tickets. You can also learn more about the artist by clicking a button. This project takes advantage of the SeatGeek api and the Wikipedia api.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site takes in a typed artist, and compares the name to the SeatGeek api, searches for the user number, and then will search for information based on that user number.
